converted to still water(9) in Minecraft, and sometimes crashes the game.

- Memory errors in the renderer will decrease the view distance setting and ask you to restart MCEdit.

Alpha 43:

rendering distance, and it doubles when up in space and not rendering in high detail.

Alpha 42:
 - Added key controls (E R) to the Fill tool for swapping materials and turning on replace mode.
