Included with this software are several image files taken from Minecraft that are property of Mojang Specifications. I do not claim any rights to them. They are included to allow MCEdit to display the correct graphics when editing levels from older versions of Minecraft.

The graphic for the Minecraft toolbar, gui.png, is not needed for compatibility and can be replaced with original art or a more fitting toolbar UI.
